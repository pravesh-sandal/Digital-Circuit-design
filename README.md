# Digital-Circuit-design
This repository features custom digital circuit designs using 45nm CMOS technology with Cadence EDA tools. It covers the full schematic to GDSII flow, including schematic design, custom layout, DRC/LVS checks, parasitic extraction, and post-layout simulation for optimized, fabrication-ready circuits.
