This repository showcases custom digital circuit designs implemented using 45nm CMOS technology following the complete schematic to GDSII flow using Cadence EDA tools.

It includes the design, layout, and verification of key digital blocks using transistor-level CMOS logic. Each circuit is optimized for area, performance, and power, adhering to foundry design rules and verified through physical and electrical checks.

üîπ Key Features:
* Technology: 45nm CMOS process
* Toolchain: Cadence Virtuoso, Assura/Calibre, Spectre
* Schematic Design using transistor-level logic
* Custom Layout with area and parasitic optimization
* DRC (Design Rule Check) compliant layouts
* LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) verification
* PEX (Parasitic Extraction) and Post-Layout Simulation
* GDSII generation for fabrication-ready output

üìê Circuits Designed:
Basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, etc.)
Combinational and sequential circuits
Arithmetic blocks (e.g., adders)

üéØ Objective:
To gain hands-on experience in deep submicron digital IC design using custom VLSI techniques, demonstrating a full custom flow from schematic capture to GDSII layout, ready for tape-out.
